# Stanford-Dogs-Classification

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive implementation of a deep learning model designed to classify dog breeds from the Stanford Dogs Dataset. Using advanced techniques in image processing and deep learning, this project aims to accurately identify various dog breeds from images.

## 📁 Dataset

* **Dataset Source:** Stanford Dogs Dataset
* **Number of Classes:** 120 dog breeds
* **Number of Images:** 20,580 high-resolution images
* **Preprocessing:** Images are resized, normalized, and augmented for improved model performance.

## 🚦 Key Files

* `Stanford Dogs.ipynb`: Main notebook containing the model training and evaluation process.
* `dataset.ipynb`: Notebook dedicated to data exploration and preprocessing.
* `Dataset/`: Folder containing the images used for training and testing.
* `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## 🌟 Features

* Utilizes transfer learning techniques for improved model accuracy.
* Custom data augmentation for better generalization.
* Supports evaluation and visualization of model performance.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/muhammadnouman911/Stanford-Dogs-Classification.git
   cd Stanford-Dogs-Classification
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the Model:**
